    <a href="{{ url }}">{{ url }}</a><br><br>
    you can click the link to continue the redirect on this device, but if you
    would rather access the page on a different machine, you can instead use
    that one to go to<br><br>
    <a href="{{ handoff }}">{{ handoff }}</a><br><br>
    and resume the invitation process where you left off
